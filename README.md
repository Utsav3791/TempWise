# TempWise: IoT Temperature Controlled Self-Regulatory System

TempWise is an IoT-based temperature-controlled system designed using the Arduino MKR 1000 Wi-Fi and Arduino IoT Cloud. The system allows remote monitoring and automated control of temperature, utilizing a fan to regulate the environment based on user-defined thresholds.

## Project Structure

- **arduino_secrets.h**: Contains Wi-Fi credentials and other secret keys required for connecting to the Arduino IoT Cloud. Ensure this file is correctly configured with your network's SSID and password.

- **mkr1000.ino**: The main Arduino sketch for the TempWise project, designed for the Arduino MKR 1000 Wi-Fi board. It reads temperature data using a DHT22 sensor and controls the fan based on the temperature readings and user-configured settings from the IoT Cloud.

- **TempWise_jun22a.ino**: A backup or alternate version of the main Arduino sketch. Ensure it reflects the latest features and configurations present in `mkr1000.ino`.

- **thingProperties.h**: Generated by the Arduino IoT Cloud. It includes the properties linked to the cloud, such as temperature, fan state, and override controls. This file is automatically generated when you set up your device in the Arduino IoT Cloud.

- **sketch.json**: Contains metadata and configuration details about the Arduino sketch, including the required libraries and board settings.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview and instructions for the TempWise project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect the DHT22 temperature sensor to the Arduino MKR 1000 Wi-Fi board using the following pins:
  - **VCC** to **5V** or **3.3V** (depending on your board).
  - **GND** to **GND**.
  - **Data** to **Pin 5**.
- Connect the fan control circuit to **Pin 2** of the Arduino MKR 1000 Wi-Fi.

### 2. Software Setup
- Open the `mkr1000.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
  - `WiFi101`
  - `ArduinoIoTCloud`
  - `DHT` and `DHT_U`
- Configure the `arduino_secrets.h` file with your Wi-Fi credentials:
  ```cpp
  #define SECRET_SSID "your_ssid"
  #define SECRET_PASS "your_password"
  ```
- Upload the mkr1000.ino sketch to your Arduino MKR 1000 Wi-Fi board.

### 3. Arduino IoT Cloud Setup
- Create a new Thing in the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.
- Define the following variables in the cloud:
    - temperature (Read-Only)
    - max_temp (Read/Write)
    - fan_on (Read/Write)
    - override_fan_control (Read/Write)
- Generate and download the thingProperties.h file and include it in your project.

### 4. Testing and Usage
- Monitor the serial output to check the temperature readings.
- Use the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard to set the max_temp and control the fan operation.
- The system will automatically regulate the temperature by turning the fan on or off based on the configured ```max_temp```.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding support for additional sensors (e.g., humidity, air quality).
- Integrating with other home automation systems for a comprehensive smart home solution.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive temperature control.
